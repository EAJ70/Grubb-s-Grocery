This website was created by Eric Jeffords, Wesley King, and Cameron Lewis. This website was made for Grubb's Grocery of Jackson, Tennessee for a school project.
The problems we came across included the following:
  The columns on our Deli and Juice Bar page are in one column instead of two.
  Our Products page sometimes does not function at all.
  Our navbar was two different colors and word placement was a struggle.
  Background pictures were difficult to obtain and place as needed.
  Our slideshows were not cooperating and multiple formats were used in order to make it work.
  Activiating hyperlinks were a problem.
